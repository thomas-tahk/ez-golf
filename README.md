# ⛳ EZ-Golf

> **The Problem**: Golfers struggle to identify exactly what's holding back their game. Traditional scorecards only show numbers - they don't reveal whether poor scores come from putting, driving, course management, or consistency issues.

> **The Solution**: A smart golf tracking app that not only records your scores but analyzes your performance patterns to pinpoint specific improvement areas and suggests targeted practice drills.

## Why I Built This

As someone who loves golf but got frustrated seeing the same scores without understanding *why*, I wanted to create a tool that goes beyond simple scorekeeping. Most golf apps just store data - this one actually helps you get better by identifying patterns you might miss.

**Key Insight**: The difference between a good round and a bad round often comes down to 2-3 specific skills. This app finds those skills for you.

*Built as part of a workshop with the Albuquerque Google Developer Group - implementing real-world React patterns and offline-first architecture.*

## What Makes It Different

- **Intelligent Analysis**: Rules-based engine that connects your scores to specific game areas (putting, driving, short game, consistency)
- **Actionable Insights**: Instead of just "you shot 85," get "focus on putting - you're losing 4 strokes per round on greens"
- **Offline-First**: Works completely without internet (perfect for golf courses with poor cell service)
- **Zero Setup**: No accounts, no backend - just open and start tracking

## Quick Start

```bash
# Get up and running in 30 seconds
git clone https://github.com/thomas-tahk/ez-golf.git
cd ez-golf
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:5174` and start with the pre-loaded famous courses (Pebble Beach, Augusta National, St. Andrews).

## Core Features

### 🏌️ Smart Course Management
- Pre-loaded famous courses (Pebble Beach, Augusta, St. Andrews)
- Custom course builder with hole-by-hole configuration
- Intuitive mobile-first interface

### 📊 Live Round Tracking
- Touch-friendly scoring for each hole
- Add contextual comments ("missed 3-foot putt", "great drive")
- Automatic save - never lose a round

### 🧠 Performance Analysis Engine
The app analyzes your rounds to identify:
- **Putting Issues**: High scores on par 3s, putting-related struggles
- **Driving Problems**: Difficulties on longer holes, tee shot inconsistencies  
- **Short Game Weaknesses**: Chipping, pitching, bunker play
- **Consistency Gaps**: High variance in scoring patterns

### 🎯 Personalized Recommendations
Get specific, actionable practice suggestions:
- Prioritized improvement areas
- Targeted drills for your weak spots
- Course management strategies
- Mental game tips

## Tech Stack & Architecture Decisions

**Frontend**: React 18 + TypeScript (for type safety and modern patterns)
**Styling**: Tailwind CSS (rapid UI development)
**State**: React Context + useReducer (avoiding unnecessary complexity)
**Build**: Vite (fast development experience)
**Storage**: localStorage (offline-first philosophy)
**PWA**: Service Worker (works without internet)

### Why These Choices?
- **Offline-First**: Golf courses often have poor cell service - the app works completely offline
- **No Backend**: Reduces complexity and deployment overhead while maintaining full functionality
- **TypeScript**: Catches errors early and improves code maintainability
- **Context API**: Lightweight state management without Redux overhead

## How It Works

1. **Track**: Record scores hole-by-hole with optional comments
2. **Analyze**: Rules engine processes your data to identify patterns
3. **Improve**: Get specific recommendations based on your weak areas
4. **Repeat**: Track progress over time with trend visualization

## Development Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge**: Creating meaningful analysis without machine learning  
**Solution**: Developed rules-based engine that identifies patterns golfers actually care about

**Challenge**: Offline functionality on mobile  
**Solution**: Service Worker implementation with localStorage persistence

**Challenge**: Mobile-friendly scoring interface  
**Solution**: Touch-optimized UI that works with gloves on

## Future Enhancements

- **AI Integration**: OpenAI/Claude-powered insights for even smarter analysis
- **Backend Sync**: Cloud storage with multi-device synchronization
- **Social Features**: Share rounds and compete with friends

## What I Learned

This rapid development project taught me:
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Leveraging modern tools to quickly prototype complex applications
- **Problem-focused development**: Starting with real user pain points (my parents!) rather than cool tech
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Building meaningful functionality in minimal time constraints
- **Offline-first architecture**: Designing for unreliable connectivity from the start
- **Performance analysis**: Creating algorithms that provide actionable insights quickly
